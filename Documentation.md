## Interfaces

### `IAnimationPlayer`

This interface allows you to create your own player or separate all the others.

|Methods|Description|
|-------|----------|
|```Play(Action onCompleteCallback)```|Play all animations|
|```AsyncPlay()```|Play all animations asynchronously|
|```Prepare()```|Prepares the player for animation playback|

### `IReadOnlyAnimation`

This interface allows you to access all the public properties of Animation without giving access to change it.
You can read more about its properties in `Animation`.

## Abstracts

### `BasePlayer : IAnimationPlayer`

This component is basic for all animation players. You may need it to separate all players or create your own.

|Methods|Description|
|-------|----------|
|```Play(Action onCompleteCallback)```|Play all animations|
|```AsyncPlay()```|Play all animations asynchronously|
|```Prepare()```|Prepares the player for animation playback|

|Field|Description|
|-------|----------|
|```IsUI```|Set the value to true if the object is part of the UI.|
|```PlayOnAwake```|Set the value to true if you want the animation to be played in the Awake method.|
|```PlayOnEnable```|Set the value to true if you want the animation to be played in the OnEnable method.|

|Property|Description|
|-------|----------|
|```IsUsingInUI```|Returns the value of the IsUI field.|

#### Example

```csharp
public class MyPlayer : BasePlayer
{
    public override void Play(Action onCompleteCallback)
    {
        //Do something

        onCompleteCallback?.Invoke();
    }

    public override async UniTask AsyncPlay()
    {
        //Do something and wait;
    }
}
```

---

### `SimpleAnimationPlayer : BasePlayer`

The component is used to create a single animation on an object. The name and order of the animation are not specified in this case. You can achieve the same effect using AnimationPlayer, but for more convenience, we recommend using this component.

|Methods|Description|
|-------|----------|
|```Play(Action onAnimationEnded = null)```|Play animation|
|```AsyncPlay()```|Play animation asynchronously|
|```Prepare()```|Prepares the player for animation playback|

|Properties|Description|
|-------|----------|
|```IReadOnlyAnimation Animation```|A read-only animation instance|

#### Example

```csharp
public class Example : MonoBehaviour 
{
    [SerializeField] private SimpleAnimationPlayer _player;

    private void Start() 
    {
        Play();
        PlayWithCallback();
    } 

    //It just plays the animation.
    private void Play() 
    {
        _player.Play();
    }

    //When the animation is completed, a message will be displayed
    private void PlayWithCallback() 
    {
        _player.Play(() => print("Ended"));
    }
}
```

### `AnimationsPlayer : BasePlayer`

The component is used to play multiple animations. You can play them simultaneously or one after the other, as well as play them in groups.

|Methods|Description|
|-------|----------|
|```Play(Action onAnimationEnded = null)```|Play all animations|
|```AsyncPlay()```|Play all animations asynchronously|
|```Prepare()```|Prepares the player for animation playback|

|Properties|Description|
|-------|----------|
|```IReadOnlyList<IReadOnlyAnimation> Animations```|A read-only animations list instance|

#### Example

```csharp
public class Example : MonoBehaviour 
{
    [SerializeField] private AnimationsPlayer _player;

    private void Start() 
    {
        Play();
        PlayWithCallback();
    } 

    //It just plays the all animations.
    private void Play() 
    {
        _player.Play();
    }

    //When the animations is completed, a message will be displayed
    private void PlayWithCallback() 
    {
        _player.Play(() => print("Ended"));
    }
}
```

### `AnimationPlayersQueue : BasePlayer`

Replays all the `BasePlayer` one after another, waiting for each one to be completed.

|Methods|Description|
|-------|----------|
|```Play(Action onAnimationEnded = null)```|Play all animations|
|```AsyncPlay()```|Play all animations asynchronously|
|```Prepare()```|Prepares the player for animation playback|

#### Example
```csharp
public class Example : MonoBehaviour 
{
    [SerializeField] private AnimationQueuePlayer _player;

    private void Start() 
    {
        _player.Play(); //A regular call
        _player.Play(OnAnimationsEnded); //Calling the method with callback
    }

    private void OnAnimationsEnded() 
    {
        print("Ended");
    }
}
```
---
### `AnimationPlayersGroup`

This component calls all child players one after the other immediately or at a specified interval (it can be changed in runtime via the inspector). You can also create any player on the same object, and after it finishes playing, all the others will be played.

|Methods|Description|
|-------|----------|
|```Play(Action onAnimationEnded = null)```|Play all animations|
|```AsyncPlay()```|Play all animations asynchronously|
|```Prepare()```|Prepares the player for animation playback|

#### Example

```csharp
public class Example : MonoBehaviour 
{
    [SerializeField] private AnimationPlayersGroup _playersGroup;

    //It just plays the all animations.
    private void Start() 
    {
        _playersGroup.Play();
    }
}
```
